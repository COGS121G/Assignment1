# Visibility of system status
At first entrance to our webapp, users who are visiting the app for their first time will be prompted with a login button. After logging in, they will see they not have the ability to perform actions in GrandTime.
 Once a user posts a message, it immediately appears at the top of the newsfeed, so the user knows their message was posted successfully.

# Match between system and the real world
Our website tailors to older individuals and as they are used to simple and large text we have made the site to match their expectations as much as possible.
The words and information displayed are easy to understand, and follow the same organizational structure as other social media (ex. top search bar, new message bar, followed by a news feed)

# User control and freedom
The user has control to log in, log out, search, and post messages. 
Users can “undo” their post with the delete feature, clearly marked by a big dark X.

# Consistency and standards
All features (search bar, posting, news feed) follow conventions of other comparable apps. The search bar is at the top, logout is in the upper right corner, and the delete button in top right corner of each message
 
# Error prevention
Users are informed to press the “enter” key before they submit a new post
Our interface uses larger text and buttons so elderly people have no trouble reading or using our app, but the text is not overly large so as to appear condescending.
Possible violation: App doesn’t warn the user if they really want to exit the page while they’re still writing a message. This would be to avoid the error of the user accidentally navigating away from the page in the midst of writing a message, losing the message.

# Recognition rather than recall
All objects, actions, and options are visible and easy to use. The post field and search bar have visible instructions embedded when they are left blank, and there is a help button if a user is confused.
The twitter log in button has familiar colors and is big. 
 
# Flexibility and efficiency of use
We allow the user to tailor frequent actions and accelerate message-sending by allowing them to use the enter key to send a message. One press of a button and their status is sent. 
Buttons and text are big as well as simple allowing senior users the easy of use when using the app is their vision is lacking.

# Aesthetic and minimalist design
All dialogues (search bar and post message) include only relevant and necessary information.
Aesthetics are kept to a minimal to guide senior users towards areas of focus. Big text allows them to easily digest information that might be otherwise difficult.
Possible violation: Timestamps for posts show extra information: GMT information is kind of irrelevant
 
# Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Until a user types a new message, the blank field will have default text that says “Type a new message and hit enter”
There is a help button for user to access if they are in need of help.
There’s also a giant X for each message, in case the user accidentally pressed Enter.
 
# Help and documentation
Direction is embedded into the features themselves (ex. The default text of the Post feature says to type a new message and press enter)
There is a help button in the upper right corner if the user finds anything confusing
